# Personal Finance Tracker Web Application

The Personal Finance Tracker Web Application is built using C# and ASP.NET and empowers users to effortlessly monitor and manage their financial landscape in just *three straightforward steps*! This application streamlines the process of understanding your financial situation by guiding you through the following steps:

## Features

### 1. Period Selection

At the outset, users are prompted to specify the period (month) for which they intend to enter their financial data. The application seamlessly checks whether the chosen period already exists in the database, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

### 2. Balance Sheet

The second step revolves around constructing a comprehensive "balance sheet." Here, users are invited to input their assets (what they own) and liabilities (what they owe). The application then computes their net worth for the selected period. This offers users an immediate snapshot of their financial standing.

### 3. Cashflow Statement

The final step delves into the "cash flow statement." Users are encouraged to log their income (inflow) and spending (outflow) for the chosen period. The application then accurately calculates the surplus amount they were able to save during that time frame.
